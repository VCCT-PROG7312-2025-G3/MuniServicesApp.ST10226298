# Part 2 - Local Events and Announcements Implementation

## Overview

Part 2 implements a comprehensive Local Events and Announcements feature using advanced data structures including stacks, queues, priority queues, hash tables, dictionaries, sorted dictionaries, and sets. The implementation also includes a sophisticated recommendation engine based on user search patterns.

#### Recommendation Feature (30 Marks)

**Algorithm Implementation:**

```csharp
public List<Event> GetRecommendedEvents()
{
    // 1. Analyze search history
    Dictionary<string, int> categoryFrequency = new Dictionary<string, int>();
    
    foreach (string search in _searchHistory)
    {
        foreach (string category in _categories)
        {
            if (search.ToLower().Contains(category.ToLower()))
            {
                if (!categoryFrequency.ContainsKey(category))
                    categoryFrequency[category] = 0;
                categoryFrequency[category]++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // 2. Get events from most searched categories
    var topCategories = categoryFrequency.OrderByDescending(x => x.Value).Take(3);
    List<Event> recommended = new List<Event>();
    
    foreach (var cat in topCategories)
    {
        var categoryEvents = GetEventsByCategory(cat.Key);
        recommended.AddRange(categoryEvents.Take(3));
    }
    
    // 3. Fallback to featured events
    if (recommended.Count == 0)
        recommended = GetFeaturedEvents().Take(5).ToList();
    
    return recommended.Distinct().Take(10).ToList();
}
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Analyzes user search patterns from Queue
- ✅ Tracks category frequency in searches
- ✅ Suggests events from top 3 most-searched categories
- ✅ Fallback to featured events for new users
- ✅ User-friendly presentation in dedicated panel
- ✅ Real-time updates as user searches

## Data Structures Performance Analysis

| Data Structure | Operation | Time Complexity | Use Case |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| SortedDictionary | Insert | O(log n) | Add events by date |
| SortedDictionary | Range Query | O(log n + k) | Date range filtering |
| Dictionary | Lookup | O(1) | Category filtering |
| HashSet | Add | O(1) | Unique categories |
| HashSet | Contains | O(1) | Category validation |
| Queue | Enqueue | O(1) | Add search history |
| Queue | Dequeue | O(1) | Remove old searches |
| Stack | Push | O(1) | Add viewed event |
| Stack | Pop | O(1) | Remove old views |
| SortedSet | Add | O(log n) | Priority queue |
