# Part 2 - Local Events and Announcements Implementation

## Overview

Part 2 implements a comprehensive Local Events and Announcements feature using advanced data structures including stacks, queues, priority queues, hash tables, dictionaries, sorted dictionaries, and sets. The implementation also includes a sophisticated recommendation engine based on user search patterns.

**Features:**
- ✅ Analyzes user search patterns from Queue
- ✅ Tracks category frequency in searches
- ✅ Suggests events from top 3 most-searched categories
- ✅ Fallback to featured events for new users
- ✅ User-friendly presentation in dedicated panel
- ✅ Real-time updates as user searches

## User Interface Features

### Search and Filter Functionality
1. **Keyword Search**
   - Searches across event title, description, and category
   - Records search in history queue
   - Updates recommendations automatically

2. **Category Filter**
   - Dropdown populated from HashSet of unique categories
   - Instant filtering using Dictionary lookup
   - O(1) performance

3. **Date Range Filter**
   - Start and end date pickers
   - Uses SortedDictionary for efficient range queries
   - Validates date range before filtering

### Event Display
- **ListView** with columns: Title, Category, Date, Location
- **Featured events** highlighted with yellow background and bold font
- **Event count** label showing filtered results
- **Double-click** support for detailed popup view

### Details Panel

- Category, date, location, organizer information
- Full description in scrollable text box
- Featured badge for priority events

### Recommendations Panel
- Dedicated panel with light cyan background
- Lists up to 10 recommended events
- Updates based on search behavior
- Helpful message for new users

## Data Structures Performance Analysis

| Data Structure | Operation | Time Complexity | Use Case |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| SortedDictionary | Insert | O(log n) | Add events by date |
| SortedDictionary | Range Query | O(log n + k) | Date range filtering |
| Dictionary | Lookup | O(1) | Category filtering |
| HashSet | Add | O(1) | Unique categories |
| HashSet | Contains | O(1) | Category validation |
| Queue | Enqueue | O(1) | Add search history |
| Queue | Dequeue | O(1) | Remove old searches |
| Stack | Push | O(1) | Add viewed event |
| Stack | Pop | O(1) | Remove old views |
| SortedSet | Add | O(log n) | Priority queue |

## Sample Data

The application includes 8 pre-loaded events:

1. **Community Clean-Up Day** (Community, Featured, Priority 10)
2. **Water Maintenance Notice** (Utilities, Featured, Priority 9)
3. **Town Hall Meeting** (Government, Priority 5)
4. **Road Closure Alert** (Infrastructure, Featured, Priority 8)
5. **Recycling Drive** (Environment, Priority 3)
6. **Public Safety Workshop** (Safety, Priority 6)
7. **Farmers Market** (Community, Featured, Priority 7)
8. **Library Book Sale** (Culture, Priority 4)
